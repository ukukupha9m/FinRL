Stock Market Environments

Considering the stochastic and interactive nature of the automated stock trading tasks, a financial task is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. The training process involves observing stock price change, taking an action and rewardâ€™s calculation to have the agent adjusting its strategy accordingly. By interacting with the environment, the trading agent will derive a trading strategy with the maximized rewards as time proceeds.
