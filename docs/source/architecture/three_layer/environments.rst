1. Stock Market Environments
============================

Considering the stochastic and interactive nature of the automated stock trading tasks, a financial task is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. FinRL-Meta first preprocesses the market data, and then builds stock market environments. The environemnt observes the change of stock price and multiple features, and the agent takes an action and receives the reward from the environment, and finally the agent adjusts its strategy accordingly. By interacting with the environment, the smart agent will derive a trading strategy to maximize the long-term accumulated rewards (also named as Q-value).

We follow the DataOps paradigm in the data layer.

- We establish a standard pipeline for financial data engineering in RL, ensuring data of **different formats** from different sources can be incorporated in **a unified framework**.

- We automate this pipeline with a **data processor**, which can access data, clean data, and extract features from various data sources with high quality and efficiency. Our data layer provides agility to model deployment.

- We employ a **training-testing-trading pipeline**. The DRL agent first learns from the training environment and is then validated in the validation environment for further adjustment. Then the validated agent is tested in historical datasets. Finally, the tested agent will be deployed in paper trading or live trading markets. First, this pipeline **solves the information leakage problem** because the trading data are never leaked when adjusting agents. Second, a unified pipeline **allows fair comparisons** among different algorithms and strategies.
