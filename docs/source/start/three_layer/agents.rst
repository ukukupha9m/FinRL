2. DRL Agents
============================

DRL agents are built by fine-tuned standard DRL algorithms depending on three famous DRL library: ElegantRL, Stable Baseline 3, and RLlib. 

The supported algorithms include: DQN, DDPG, Multi-Agent DDPG, PPO, SAC, A2C and TD3. We also allow users to design their own DRL algorithms by adapting these DRL algorithms, e.g., Adaptive DDPG, or employing ensemble methods. The comparison of DRL algorithms is shown in the table bellow:

Users are able to choose their favorite DRL agents for training. Different DRL agents might have different performance in various tasks.
