## Status: Release
<details><summary><b>Current status</b> <i>[click to expand]</i></summary>
<div>
We are currently open to any suggestions or pull requests from the community to make RLzoo a better repository. Given the scope of this project, we expect there could be some issues over
the coming months after initial release. We will keep improving the potential problems and commit when significant changes are made in the future. Current default hyperparameters for each algorithm and each environment may not be optimal, so you can play around with those hyperparameters to achieve best performances. We will release a version with optimal hyperparameters and benchmark results for all algorithms in the future.
